# TCP Logger

What is TCP?

- Stands for Transmission Control Protocol
- Allows for the transfer of data (bytes of information) across the network
- Has the concept of a connection between a client and a server
- It protects against data corruption by using checksums of the data that get sent

What is `telnet`?

- When referring to `telnet` here, we are talking about the CLI tool we will be using to establish a TCP connection
- There is a `telnet` text-based protocol, but we are just using the tool to send text over TCP
